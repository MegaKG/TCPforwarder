# TCPforwarder
Proxies TCP connections (C++ Edition)

Work In Progress.

This application (Prototyped in python3) proxies TCP connections.

It works as follows:
- Accept a connection
- Start a connection to a client
- Forward traffic both ways

Currently in the process of debugging the program, but it does work (somewhat).
